<h3>
Sponsorships
</h3>
<p>
Sponsorships are an important part of our organization's work. The lack of education is one of the main problems that children and teenagers in Ghana are confronted with. Many families live in poor circumstances and do not have the necessary means to enable their kids a school education.
</p>
<p>
From among the many underprivileged children Future Hope People chooses those who live in especially dire circumstances and tries to find sponsorships for them. Our sponsorships are construed for long-term support and enable these children to go to school regularly.
</p>
<p>
A sponsorship amounts to 15 Euro per month and includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
School uniform
</li>
<li>
School supplies (Books, notebooks, pens etc.)
</li>
<li>
Meals in school
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A part of the sponsorship money is used for our project work and thus helps all children of that specific school. Contrary to other organizations where the sponsored children often stay anonymous we encourage the contact between sponsors and children. You can always send your sponsored child a letter and you will receive copies of school reports which document your child's school progress.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
To become a sponsor please download the
<a href="/documents/Future%20Hope%20People%20Patenschaftsantrag.pdf">sponsorship application form</a>
(in German) and send a filled in and signed copy to the address noted on the form. We will contact you as soon as possible with information and photos of a child that is currently looking for a sponsorship!

Voluntary work
</h3>
<p>
Future Hope People offers volunteers the possibility to come to Ghana and actively support our work. There is also the possibility for students to do a study or work related internship in the fields of social work, youth and educational work.
</p>
<p>
A stay in Ghana consists of development work and cultural exchange and the attendants actively work in one of our projects while they get to know the country and its culture during excursions and other activities. A minimum stay of one month in Ghana is reasonable. Traveling expenses have to be paid by the attendant and the cost for board and lodging are 350 Euro per month.
</p>
<p>
The following experience reports (in German) provide you an insight into the experiences of some of our volunteers:
